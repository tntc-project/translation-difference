# TML-Translation-Difference
Translation metalanguage of translation difference, consisting of strategy typology and a list of examples, has been developed in the TNTC project supported by the JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S) 19H05660: [Developing a Translation Process Model and Constructing an Integrated Translation Environment Through Detailed Descriptions of Translation Norms and Competences](https://tntc.p.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/).

## Author
TML-Translation-Difference-v1-JA was developed by Tomono Honda and Atsushi Fujita.

This typology is the outcome of refining the scheme for describing differences between translations proposed by Honda et al. (2022) and adopting translation strategies proposed by Chesterman (2016) and Yamamoto and Yamada (2022). The details of the development of our scheme, including the process of adaptation from Chesterman (2016), Yamamoto and Yamada (2022), and Honda et al. (2022) are described in Honda et al. (2023).

The files for download were created by Tomono Honda.
